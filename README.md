# How To Do Stuff

This repo is intended to be a compendium of various bits and pieces of explanatory text that I've written in my spare time over the years.  At present there's not much here; it consists really of just two incomplete things I've been working on.  They are:

- A non-technical guide to Git.
- A concise guide to C# syntax.

Although the Git guide is non-technical, it works from the premise that the best way to understand Git workflows is to work upwards from its most basic low-level concepts, because I've found that most Git userguides are written for technical people in a very top-down way, starting with a specific workflow in mind and only discussing the fundamental data model as an occasional aside.

The C# guide is very much incomplete, and is written for people who are already developers and who might need to pick up C# in a hurry.  I made a valient attempt to write it without including any forward references, which is something of a tricky task.

This repo is not very frequently updated, but I am always open to suggestions for edits or inclusions.  As both of the current projects are works-in-progress, both come to a juddering halt midway through at present.
